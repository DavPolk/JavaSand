____ Java Sand _____

This game was created by David Polk as a final project for cs240 in fall of 2023 at IUPUI.

To play:
With java 17+: Download and run the executable jar. Navigate to the directory with the jar and run with this command if you cannot double click to run: java -jar javaSand.jar

Older java versions: code -> download zip. Extract to a folder, and run the command "make run" in the directory



This is my version of a falling sand game(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-sand_game),
which is a sandbox game where users can place different elements into the game world and watch how they interact.
Heavy inspiration was taken from the original falling sand game.
